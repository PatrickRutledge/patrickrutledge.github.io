      <p><strong>Welcome to my website!</strong></p>

      <h3>Professional</h3>
      <p>
        Today, I serve as the Strategic Director and Principal Advisor for several private companies. I previously served as CEO of Fiddlesticks Wood Products, a manufacturer of cooking and fuelwood products, where I engineered and orchestrated the vertical integration of functions into divisions, entities, and partners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result was a highly controlled internal supply chain, encompassing:
        <ul>
          <li>Green Yard Sourcing – Collection and preprocessing of recycled content</li>
          <li>Manufacturing – Conversion of log truckloads into processed products</li>
          <li>Packaging – On-premises processing and co-packer management</li>
          <li>Wholesale Distribution – Packaged fuelwood to Mass Market Retail</li>
          <li>Alabama Cooking Wood – Brand-specific distribution to restaurants</li>
          <li>Direct-to-Consumer E-commerce – Tailored products & fulfillment systems</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience spans diverse industries and roles. A natural curiosity drives me to analyze complex problems and deliver solutions through collaboration. From factory floor to balance sheet, I value strategy, integration, and outcomes. <a href="cv.pdf" target="_blank">Check out my CV if you want to know more →</a>
      </p>

      <h3>Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        I believe the ultimate purpose of life is to become a better being. Life is hard—and we’re built to overcome. Cultivating myself is about stewardship and empathy. I strive to contribute to a more enlightened world, not just contemplate one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal development demands honesty about limitations, failures, and vanities. I believe in truth, discipline, and growth. Virtue is demanding—integrity even more so. My aim is to be fruitful, subdue myself, and produce something worthwhile.
      </p>

      <h3>My Interests</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy time with family, friends, and meaningful groups. When it comes to recreation—I like it. I haven’t caught all the fish, grown everything in the garden, shot more than one perfect skeet round, or built the finest piece of furniture yet. I haven’t swum the English Channel either. But Sudoku? That I can do.
